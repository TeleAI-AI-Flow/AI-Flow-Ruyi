## Introduction

**AI-Flow-Ruyi** is a **Familial Model** developed by the AI Flow team  of the Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom. Designed for next-generation "Device-Edge-Cloud" model service architectures, its core innovation lies in **shared familial parameters** across large and small models. Leveraging an **early-exit mechanism**, the system dynamically routes queries to branch models of appropriate parameter sizes based on problem complexity. These branches operate independently while enabling **information sharing** and **seamless transitions** through their shared features. Combined with distributed Device-Edge-Cloud deployment, this facilitates **collaborative inference** within the model family, significantly enhancing distributed reasoning efficiency.

## AI-Flow-Ruyi-7B

To give the community a hands-on experience with a truly elastic ‚Äúfamily of models,‚Äù we are open-sourcing the Ruyi-7B (AI-Flow-Ruyi-7B), released on 25 July. Its largest branch contains 7 billion parameters and can spawn early-exit sub-networks with effective parameter counts of 3 B, 4 B, 5 B, and 6 B:

Key branch specializations:
* **3B/4B branches**: Optimized for simple dialogue scenarios, delivering **faster response times** with **minimal resource consumption**
* **5B/6B branches**: Targeting daily general-purpose tasks, **striking a balance** between capability and responsiveness
* **7B branch**: Designed for complex problem-solving, **exhibiting more well-rounded capabilities** across multiple dimensions ‚Äì though with **moderately slower inference speeds** and **higher resource demands**

|Position No.|Early-Exit Layer|Equivalent Model Size|Branch Designation|Target Scenario|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|Layer 11|3B|AI-Flow-Ruyi-7B-E3B|Simple dialogue|
|2|Layer 15|4B|AI-Flow-Ruyi-7B-E4B|Simple dialogue|
|3|Layer 19|5B|AI-Flow-Ruyi-7B-E5B|Daily tasks|
|4|Layer 23|6B|AI-Flow-Ruyi-7B-E6B|Daily tasks|
|5|Layer 27|7B|AI-Flow-Ruyi-7B-E7B|Complex problems|

### Training process

Prior to training initiation, we initialized parameters for the 7B main branch using Qwen team's pre-trained [Qwen2.5-7B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15115) (pre-trained on 18 trillion high-quality tokens). For early-exit branches, decoder layers were initialized with parameters from the subsequent layer of their respective early-exit positions.

Following initialization, we conducted **multi-branch joint pre-training** with approximately 400 billion tokens on proprietary high-quality datasets, resulting in the AI-Flow-Ruyi-7B-Base foundation model.

Subsequently, we performed **multi-branch joint instruction-following fine-tuning** across all branches using ~0.7 million high-quality instruction samples, yielding the AI-Flow-Ruyi-7B.

### Performance review

We conduct a review based on [OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass) and its official configuration files on multiple datasets in a 0-shot manner.

The evaluation results show that the 7B master branch is basically equal to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct in terms of general-purpose task performance.
